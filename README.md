- 👋 Hi, I’m @xk2600, formally Chris Stephan.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things computing, but I've spent a majority of my career interconnecting 
  information systems as a Network Engineer and Architect.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can get my hands into, major topics over the past 3 years 
  have revolved around network automation, kubernetes, FreeBSD, Arista EOS, and GoLang.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I'm pretty swamped raising three boys.
